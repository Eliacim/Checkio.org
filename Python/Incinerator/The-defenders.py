...the clashes between different soldiers occurred here and there, and the new
troops kept coming. The conflict gradually was starting to look more like a
small war. "Knights, hear my command! Take your shields! Strengthen the armor!
We are taking too much beating," - Sir Ronald shouted. Nobodyâ€™s expected that
Umbert's soldiers could compete with the well-trained knights, so at the
beginning of the battle the knights used exclusively two-handed swords - no one
even thought of being on the defensive. But it seems that it's time to back
down and take one-handed swords and shields instead of the former deadly
weapons. This will slightly reduce the assault capacity of knights, but will
allow them to better defend themselves against the dangerous attacks of enemy
soldiers.

In the previous mission - Army battles, you've learned how to make a battle
between 2 armies. But we have only 2 types of units - the Warriors and Knights.
Let's add another one - the Defender. It should be the subclass of the Warrior
class and have an additional defense parameter, which helps him to survive
longer. When another unit hits the defender, he loses a certain amount of his
health according to the next formula: enemy attack - self defense (if enemy
attack > self defense). Otherwise, the defender doesn't lose his health.

The basic parameters of the Defender:
health = 60
attack = 3
defense = 2

Input: The warriors and armies.
Output: The result of the battle (True or False).

How it is used: For the computer games development.

Note: From now on, the tests from "check" part will use another type of
warrior: the rookie. Its code is

    class Rookie(Warrior):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.health = 50
            self.attack = 1

Precondition: 3 types of units
