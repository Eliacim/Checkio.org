Fizz Buzz
Elementary

"Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division.
Let's learn computers.

You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
"Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
"Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
The number as a string for other cases.
Input: A number as an integer.

Output: The answer as a string.

Example:

checkio(15) == "Fizz Buzz"
checkio(6) == "Fizz"
checkio(5) == "Buzz"
checkio(7) == "7"

Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 1000
'''


def checkio(number: int) -> str:
    return 'Fizz Buzz' if number % 15 == 0 else 'Buzz' if number % 5 == 0\
        else 'Fizz' if number % 3 == 0 else str(number)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Example:')
    print(checkio(15))
    print(checkio(7))

    assert checkio(15) == "Fizz Buzz", "15 is divisible by 3 and 5"
    assert checkio(6) == "Fizz", "6 is divisible by 3"
    assert checkio(5) == "Buzz", "5 is divisible by 5"
    assert checkio(7) == "7", "7 is not divisible by 3 or 5"
